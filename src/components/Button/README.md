## Button

A button is a versatile UI component that allows users to take actions, make choices, and submit data. Our buttons are available in various sizes and versions, each designed to provide the optimal interaction experience across the platform.

### When to use

* When you want users to initiate or commit to an action like `Save`, `Submit`, `Delete`, etc.
* As a call-to-action, leading users to another part of the application or webpage.
* For confirming user decisions or choices.
