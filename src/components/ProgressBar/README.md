### RadioGroup

The Progress Bar is a visual representation of a task's completion or the duration of a process. With varying sizes and states, it provides immediate feedback about the progress of a particular action or task, ensuring users can gauge how much has been done and how much remains.

#### When to use

- _Task Progression:_ When you want to show the completion rate of a particular task, such as file uploads, installations, or form completions
- _Visual Feedback:_ Providing a visual indicator for lengthy operations assures users that the system is actively processing their request
- _Sequential Steps:_ In multi-step processes or workflows, indicating progress helps users gauge their position in the sequence.

```tsx
<ProgressBar variant="primary" size="medium" progress={70} />
```
